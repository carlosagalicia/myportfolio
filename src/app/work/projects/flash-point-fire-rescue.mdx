# Flash Point: Fire Rescue - Simulation and Visualization

This project combines Python and Unity to simulate and visualize the board game "Flash Point: Fire Rescue." The game logic is implemented in the main file `firefighterv2.py`, allowing the computer to play the game automatically and strategically by running the simulation in Python and generating a JSON file. Unity uses this JSON file to display the game's movements and events in a 3D visual environment.

## Overview

- **Simulation:** Python generates game data in JSON format.
- **Visualization:** Unity consumes the JSON file and graphically represents the game's movements and events.
- **Objective:** Create a complete experience that combines automated game logic with an engaging visual interface.

## Key Learning Areas

### 1. Simulation with Python
- **Data Generation:**
  - Implementation of game rules to simulate turns, movements, and events such as fires and explosions.
  - Use of data structures to model the board, firefighters, and game objectives.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Modeling game elements (firefighters, buildings, fire) as classes.
  - Using methods to define interactions between elements.
- **Game Simulation:**
  - Implementation of "Flash Point: Fire Rescue" rules.
  - Simulation of random events such as explosions or fire spread.
- **Automated Strategies:**
  - Algorithms to make optimal decisions based on the board's state.
- **JSON Export:**
  - Serialization of game state data into a JSON file for Unity to process.

### 2. Visual Representation with Unity
- **JSON Import:**
  - Use of **C#** scripts to read the JSON file generated by Python.
  - Translating JSON data into movements and events within Unity.
- **3D Graphics:**
  - Visual representation of the game board, firefighters, and fire.
  - Animations showing movements and actions in real-time.
- **Interactivity:**
  - Configuration of cameras and visual effects to enhance the user experience.

## Languages and Tools Used

### Python
- **`json` Library:** For serializing and saving game data.
- **Simulation Algorithms:** To calculate game actions and events.

### Unity
- **C#:** Main language for scripts interpreting JSON data.
- **3D Graphics:** Models and animations to represent the board and game events.
- **TextMesh Pro:** For displaying text (e.g., scores or messages) on the screen.

## Project Structure

- **Python:**
  - `firefighterv2.py`: Main script that generates the simulation and exports the JSON file.

- **Unity:**
  - `Assets/Scripts`: Contains C# scripts for loading and processing the JSON file.
  - `Assets/Scenes`: Game scenes representing the board and events.
  - `Assets/Models`: 3D models of game characters and objects.

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- **Python 3.x** to run the simulation.
- **Unity Hub** and a recent version of Unity for visualization.
